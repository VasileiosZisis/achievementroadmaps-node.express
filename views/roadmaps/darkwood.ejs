                    <h1>Does it worth your time?</h1>
                    <p>Darkwood is a slow-paced and very challenging game. During the day you explore the map, loot
                        everything you can while trying to progress through the story and during the night you stay at
                        your hideout trying to survive against the incoming enemies. Combat is the hardest part of the
                        game and unless you spend some time to master it, you will find yourself spending most of your
                        time looking for your dead body to collect back your items. The game auto-saves when you die and
                        during major events and that means there is only one opportunity per playthrough to unlock the
                        majority of the achievements. Hardly anything is explained ingame, so you are left to discover
                        the mechanics by yourself.</p>
                    <h2>First Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>The game gives you the option to skip the prologue, but for this playthrough do not skip it for
                        <span class="achievement">Finished prologue</span>. During chapter 1 go for the <span
                            class="achievement">Wolf's path</span>, the easiest of the two major story choices. Also go
                        for <span class="achievement">Kill the pig</span>, the only missable achievement for chapter 1.
                        <span class="achievement">Chapter 2</span> will unlock when chapter 2 starts. At this point as
                        you level up be aware of <span class="achievement">Sleep in the grave</span> and <span
                            class="achievement">No sleep for the wicked</span>, both are missable and only one can be
                        completed per playthrough. <span class="achievement">Trapped villagers</span> is connected with
                        Kill the pig. There are two ways to end chapter 2. For this playthrough go for <span
                            class="achievement">Insatiable hunger</span> which allows to do <span
                            class="achievement">Only ashes remain</span>. Lastly for the epilogue play normally and
                        unlock <span class="achievement">Bliss</span>, then load your save, replay the epilogue and
                        unlock <span class="achievement">Burn them all</span>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Second Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>On your second playthrough there should be five achievements left. You can safely skip the
                        prologue and do not forget <span class="achievement">Sleep in the grave</span> or <span
                            class="achievement">No sleep for the wicked</span>, depending on which
                        you unlocked on your first playthrough. During chapter 1 choose the <span
                            class="achievement">Musician's path</span>. There are two achievements available because of
                        Musician's path: during chapter 1 <span class="achievement">Willpower</span> and during chapter
                        2 <span class="achievement">Entertainer</span>, both missable. Finally you can finish chapter 2
                        with <span class="achievement">Merciful</span>.
                    </p>
