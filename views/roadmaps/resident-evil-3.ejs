                    <h1>Does it worth your time?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Resident Evil 3 shares the same characteristics with the rest of the series in the third person
                        category. It is short, below average difficulty and includes a variety of ingame challenges to
                        keep it replayable and not feel boring. Completing the game will unlock the next difficulty
                        level, and that's why you need at least 3 playthroughs to unlock all the difficulty levels.<br>
                        As you complete challenges you gain points that you can spend on the shop for items, like
                        weapons and different boosts. These will not disable achievements, and if you want to avoid
                        farming for points, do not buy anything until you are familiar with the game.<br>
                        Those shop items are important for completing the most difficult achievements such as finishing
                        the game with S rank on the highest difficulty, or finish the game without ever opening the
                        item box.
                    </p>
                    <h2>First Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>
                        For your first playthrough play on standard difficulty. Just focus on learning the game,
                        practice the aim and dodge mechanics and make as many weapon kills as possible for the
                        challenges. If you want to farm for points, this is the playthrough to do it. You need all the
                        boosts, the hip pouches and the infinite rocket launcher for the inferno difficulty. Kill
                        Nemesis at least once at the first part of the game when he ambushes you for <span
                            class="achievement">Nemesis Down</span> and kill the zombie at the entrance of the police
                        station with Carlos for <span class="achievement">An Unfortunate End</span>. A fair number of

                        defeating two enemies with one shot, <span class="achievement">Basic Chemistry</span> for

                    </p>
                    <h2>Second Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>
                        For your second playthrough choose hardcore difficulty. Again do not forget the weapon kill
                        challenges. For this playthrough find all the notes and documents for <span
                            class="achievement">Bookworm</span>, destroy all the charlie dolls for <span
                            class="achievement">Goodbye, Charlie!</span>, collect all the weapons for <span

                        For this playthrough choose nightmare difficulty. Now you want to complete the game using 1 or
                        fewer recovery items for <span class="achievement">I Might Need These Later!</span>. So it is
                        time to spend your first points at the shop in case you haven't yet. You will also earn <span
                            class="achievement">Conqueror</span> for finishing the playthrough.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fourth playthrough should be on inferno and you are going for the S rank, which means finishing
                        the game under 2 hours with 5 saves or less. You want all the boosts from the shop and the
                        infinite rocket launcher. Dodge here is very important, especially during the last boss fight.
                        In this playthrough you will earn <span class="achievement">Sprinter</span>, <span
                            class="achievement">Sensational Work!</span>, <span class="achievement">Jill

                        For your final playthrough choose assisted difficulty. Your goal is to finish the game without
                        opening the item box for <span class="achievement">Minimalist</span>.
