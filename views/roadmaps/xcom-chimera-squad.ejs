                    <h1>Does it worth your time?</h1>
                    <p>Not your usual XCOM game. It plays faster since you jump immediately into combat and the story
                        cutscenes and dialogues are all skipable. There are gameplay options added that will make
                        playthroughs less boring and less stressful. Finally using mods and console commands will still
                        unlock achievements.</p>
                    <h2>First Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>Start the campaign on normal or expert and choose to play the tutorial for the <span
                            class="achievement">City on Fire</span>, the rest of the options available
                        don't matter. Soon you will have to choose your next investigation. You will have to finish
                        all three of them during the campaign and the order matters for <span class="achievement">Every
                            Timeline</span>. For this playthrough choose 1rst The Progeny, 2nd Gray Phoenix and 3rd
                        Sacred Coil. <span class="achievement">Thank You For Your Business</span> is the hardest
                        achievement. Basically you want to gain as much as intel as possible and delay the story
                        missions for as long as possible. There are 11 agent specific achievements, but only 8
                        agents are available per playthrough, so make sure to complete them for the agents you
                        chose. Capture a Praetorian, a Ronin and a Sorcecer for <span class="achievement">Use the Large
                            Cuffs</span>, <span class="achievement">Caged Sword</span> and <span
                            class="achievement">Bottled Lightning</span>. For the mission select screen there is <span
                            class="achievement">Filed Commander</span> and <span class="achievement">Friendly
                            Neighborhood XCOM</span>. For the agents <span class="achievement">All Hands On Deck</span>,
                        <span class="achievement">Overqualified</span> and <span class="achievement">Book Smart</span>.
                        No Stone Left Unturned</span> for Spec Op and <span class="achievement">Hammer And Tongs</span>
                        for the research. Finishing the campaign will earn you <span class="achievement">Heroes of City
                            31</span>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Second Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>Start a new game and for the difficulty choose impossible. You can skip the tutorial and choose
                        any other additional option you want. The investigation order should be 1rst Gray Phoenix, 2nd
                        Sacred Coil and 3rd The Progeny. You want to keep track of the Breach points for <span
                            class="achievement">I’ll Let Myself In</span>. If you do not choose the same agents you can
                        complete <span class="achievement">Chimera Unleashed</span>. Finish any achievement you may have
                        missed from the first playthrough and also do not forget the agent specific achievements.
                        Finishing the campaign will earn you <span class="achievement">Impossible Dream</span>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Third Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>Start a new game and choose story difficulty. For the investigation order choose 1rst Sacred
                        Coil, 2nd The Progeny and 3rd Gray Phoenix. Now is a good time for <span
                            class="achievement">Pacifist Route</span>, <span class="achievement">Up Close and
                            Personal</span> and <span class="achievement">…and Clear</span>. If <span
                            class="achievement">Reinforced Steel</span>, <span class="achievement">A New Look</span>,
                        <span class="achievement">Superior Firepower</span>, <span class="achievement">Machine
                            Learning</span> and <span class="achievement">Army of One</span> didn't come naturally, you
                        can finish them now. Also finish <span class="achievement">Need a Lift</span> if you haven't
                        yet. Finishing the campaign will earn you <span class="achievement">Every Timeline</span>.
