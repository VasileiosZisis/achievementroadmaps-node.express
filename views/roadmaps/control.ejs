                    <p>A very different 3rd person action-adventure with supernatural abilities and reactive
                        environments in an abstract world. All the usual achievements are there and you will need a
                        guide for only a couple of them. There is not a point-of-no-return so you can start cleaning up
                        your achievements at any point.</p>
                    <h2>First Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>There are total 18 side missions and for completing 15 side missions you will unlock <span
                            class="achievement">The Importance of Synergy</span>, <span
                            class="achievement">Inter-Departmental Cooperation</span> and <span class="achievement">FBC
                            Crisis Solution Task Force</span>, so use this as your guide so you will know how many
                        missions left, because you want to do all of them for the rewards. Pay attention to Board
                        Countermeasures for <span class="achievement">Astral Tactician</span> and Bureau Alerts for
                        <span class="achievement">Crisis Management</span>. For combat there are <span
                            class="achievement">Cognitive Intruder</span> for the Seize ability, <span
                            class="achievement">Unstable Matter</span> and <span class="achievement">Proper Handling
                            Procedures</span> for the Launch ability. For collectibles there are <span
                            class="achievement">Strange Collection</span>, <span class="achievement">Record
                            Keeper</span> and <span class="achievement">Bureau Archivist</span>, but there are more
                        collectibles in game than needed. The rest should unlock naturally.

                        feature. You need to find all hidden locations for <span class="achievement">Niche
                            Position</span> and all collectibles for <span class="achievement">Subterranean
                            Research</span>. For <span class="achievement">One of Us</span> you will most likely need a
                        guide. The rest should come naturally.
