                    <h1>Does it worth your time?</h1>
                    <p>Vampyr is a story rich, dialog heavy game, where choices matter. You spend most of your playtime
                        talking with NPCs and the choices you have to make will affect not only their fate but also the
                        main story. These, combined with the fact that there is no manual save feature, will force you
                        to pay attention to the dialogs. The combat will get repetitive but not necessarily boring. Both
                        crafting and leveling systems are simple enough, leaving you to enjoy the atmosphere, the
                        environment and the story.</p>
                    <h2>First Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>To get most of the experience the game has to offer, for your first playthrough do not kill any
                        citizens. You aim for <span class="achievement">Merciful release<span
                                class="tooltip-content"><img
                                    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/427290/60654121ec02b7fd3e9250a39f66f5e3c999c2c4.jpg">

                            </span></span>,
                        <span class="achievement">Hippocratic
                            oath</span>, <span class="achievement">Not even
                            once</span>. Other achievements you can unlock are <span class="achievement">Pest
                            control</span>, <span class="achievement">Solid metal gear</span> and <span
                            class="achievement">That's better</span>. Do not worry about collectibes, since you cannot
                        find them all on this playthrough and lastly, all story achievements will unlock no matter the
                        ending.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Second Playthrough</h2>
                    <p>For this playthrough you need to find all the collectibes, turn all districts to hostile status
                        and unlock <span class="achievement">Unlife is strange</span>. Finding all collectibes
                        will unlock <span class="achievement">The tools of the profession</span>, <span
                            class="achievement">Keep your distance</span>, <span class="achievement">Weapons of
                            choice</span>, <span class="achievement">Lore keeper</span> and <span
                            class="achievement">Bloody roots</span>. The achievements for killing everyone are
                        <span class="achievement">Just take a bite</span>, <span class="achievement">Anarchy in
                            the UK</span> and <span class="achievement">London's burning</span>. You do not need to
                        finish the game a second time to unlock all of the achievements.
